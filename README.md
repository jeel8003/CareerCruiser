# CareerCruiser


Career Cruiser is a MERN Stack-based web app designed to streamline the employment process. It allows users to select their roles (applicant or recruiter) and create an account. In this web app, login sessions are persistent, and REST APIs are securely protected using JWT token verification. After logging in, a recruiter can post job openings, and shortlist or reject applications. Applicants can browse available jobs, apply for them using various filters, and track their application status. Users can also upload, view, and edit their profiles and resumes.

Thus, Career Cruiser is an all-in-one solution for a comprehensive job application system.
